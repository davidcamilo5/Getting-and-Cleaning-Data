#### CODE ANALYSIS

###THE STRUCTURE OF THE CODE

##NAME OF THE ALL VARIABLE 
#the variable f <- is from the text separate from features.txt with <- 561 obs of 2 var
  f <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt", col.names = c("n","functions"))
#the variable a <- is from the text separate from activity_labels.txt <- 6 obs of 2 var
  a <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt", col.names = c("code", "activity"))
#the variable s <- is from the text separate from subject_test.txt <- 2947 obs of 1 var
  s <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt", col.names = "subject")
#the variable we <- is from the text separate from X_test.txt <- 2947 obs of 561 var
  we<- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt", col.names = f$functions)
#the variable pe <- is from the text separate from y_test.txt <- 2947 obs of 1 var
  pe<- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt", col.names = "code")
#the variable b <- is from the text separate from subject_train.txt <- 7352 obs of 1 var
  b <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt", col.names = "subject")
#the variable wt <- is from the text separate from X_train.txt <- 7352 obs of 561 var
  wt <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt", col.names = f$functions)
#the variable pt <- is from the text separate from y_train.txt <- 7352 obs of 1 var
  pt<- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt", col.names = "code")
  
##this process is te combine of Robjects by rows or columns
#use the rbind to take a sequence of vector, matrix or data-frame arguments and combine by rows of the wt and we  
  x<- rbind(wt, we)
#use the rbind to take a sequence of vector, matrix or data-frame arguments and combine by rows of the pt and pe  
  y<- rbind(pt, pe)
#use the rbind to take a sequence of vector,by rows of the bs and s with 10299 obs of 1 var 
  Sub <- rbind(b, s)
  Mergeddata <- cbind(Sub, y, x)
# use the "select" to Select variables in a data frame based on their properties
  Data <- Mergeddata %>% select(subject, code, contains("mean"), contains("std"))
#use gsub for perform replacement of the first and all matches respectively
  gsub("Acc", "Accelerometer", names(Data))
  gsub("Gyro", "Gyroscope", names(Data))
  gsub("BodyBody", "Body", names(Data))
  gsub("Mag", "Magnitude", names(Data))
  gsub("^t", "Time", names(Data))
  gsub("^f", "Frequency", names(Data))
  gsub("tBody", "TimeBody", names(Data))
  gsub("-mean()", "Mean", names(Data))
  gsub("-std()", "STD", names(Data))
  gsub("-freq()", "Frequency", names(Data))
  gsub("angle", "Angle", names(Data))
  gsub("gravity", "Gravity", names(Data))
#and the end only use group and summarise for creates a new data frame
  FData <- Data %>%
  group_by(subject, activity) %>%
  summarise_all(funs(mean))  
  
##ANALISYS OF THE RESULTS
  The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years.
  Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
  wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 
  we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 
  The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, 
  where 70% 
  of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data
